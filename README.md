## Making your Presentations

### Slide Format

- You can write your presentations in markdown, html, or any language that [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) supports.

  > **Note about Markdown:** if you use Markdown, you still need to separate your slides using `<section>` elements. The markdown is translated to html using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), **not** [RevealJS's markdown plugin](https://revealjs.com/markdown/). So using `---` to separate slides won't work.

- Refer to [RevealJS's Docs](https://revealjs.com/markup/) for how to write your markup

  - Basic example:
    ```html
    <section>Slide 1</section>
    <section>Slide 2</section>
    ```
  - Nested example:
    ```html
    <section>Horizontal Slide</section>
    <section>
      <section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
      <section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
    </section>
    ```
  - Example with notes:
    ```html
    <section>
      <h2>Some Slide</h2>
      <aside class="notes">Shhh, these are your private notes üìù</aside>
    </section>
    ```

### Presentation Metadata

Eleventy uses [frontmatter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) to manage data for each file/page.

The following variables are required for each presentation if you want it to show up in the list in `src/index.html`:

- `layout`
- `title`
- `tags`

The `themeName` variable is optional. It's set to `black` by default.

Example:

```yaml
# In src/demo-with-markdown/index.md
---
layout: layout_slide.njk # !required
title: "Presentation Demo: Using Markdown" # !required
tags: presentation # !required
themeName: moon # optional
---
Content goes here
```

### Plugins

All of [RevealJS's built in plugins](https://revealjs.com/plugins/#built-in-plugins) are pulled in by default. You can manage this in the `src/_includes/layout_slide.njk` file

You can also [make your own plugins](https://revealjs.com/creating-plugins/).

Custom plugin example:

```html
<!-- in src/_includes/layout_slide.njk -->

<!-- Here's an example plugin which shuffles all slides in a presentation when the T key is pressed -->

<script>
  function Toaster() {
    return {
      id: "toaster",
      init: (deck) => {
        deck.addKeyBinding({ keyCode: 84, key: "T" }, () => {
          deck.shuffle();
          console.log("üçª");
        });
      },
    };
  }

  let deck = new Reveal({
    controls: true,
    progress: true,
    overview: true,
    history: true,
    center: true,
    plugins: [
      RevealHighlight,
      RevealNotes,
      RevealSearch,
      RevealMath,
      RevealZoom,
      Toaster, // You need to add your plugin to this array
    ],
  });
  deck.initialize();
</script>
```

If you want to get fancy, you can [pull in RevealJS from npm](https://revealjs.com/installation/#installing-from-npm) instead of from the cdn, but then you'll to have to deal with setting up Javascript bundling with Eleventy.

### Theming

> If you want to edit the styles of the home page (`src/index.html`), you can do so in `src/_includes/styles.css`.

RevealJS has lots of different [themes](https://revealjs.com/themes/) you can choose from.

#### Slide Theme

By default, the [slide theme](https://revealjs.com/themes/) is set to black.

Each theme is a different stylesheet. You can edit which themes are available in the css imports in `src/_includes/layout_slide.njk`.

```liquid
<!-- src/_includes/layout_slide.njk -->
{% set css %}
    ...
    {% include "../../node_modules/reveal.js/dist/theme/black.css" %}
    ...
{% endset %}

```

By default all of [RevealJS's default themes](https://revealjs.com/themes/) are included, and you can specify a specific theme for each presentation in that presentation file's frontmatter with the `themeName` variable. For example:

```yaml
# In src/demo-with-markdown/index.md
---
layout: layout_slide.njk
title: "Presentation Demo: Using Markdown"
tags: presentation
themeName: moon
---
```

If you do not specify a `themeName`, the `black` theme is used by default.

#### Syntax Highlighting theme

By default, the [highlighting theme](https://revealjs.com/code/#theming) is set to monokai. Each theme is a different stylesheet. If you would like to change your syntax highlighting theme, you can edit its css import in the `layout_slide.njk` file.

```liquid
{% set css %}
    {% include "../../node_modules/reveal.js/plugin/highlight/monokai.css" %}
{% endset %}

```

A full list of available highlight themes can be found at https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/.

## Export to PDF

## Speaker Notes

[RevealJS Docs](https://revealjs.com/speaker-view/)

reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the ¬ªS¬´ key on your keyboard to open the notes window.

A speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened. You can reset the timer by clicking on it.

Notes are defined by appending an `<aside>` element to a slide as seen below. You can add the `data-markdown` attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown.

Alternatively you can add your notes in a `data-notes` attribute on the slide. Like `<section data-notes="Something important"></section>`.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Some Slide</h2>

  <aside class="notes">Shhh, these are your private notes üìù</aside>
</section>
```
